# Gopolar GG87 Firmware QMK/VIA

QMK code for Gopolar GG-87 Taichi Mechanical Keyboard

It works, I guess. Based on GG-86 source code.

No clue why RGUI and FN are swapped.

OLED timeout 60s. 

FN + \ to swap between bongocat and basic animation.

Flash using QMK tool box or however you like.

Use at your own risk.
